					<p>During my freshman year at Northeastern, I took a class called Cornerstone of Engineering. In that class, I developed a prototype of a product that translates sound energy into electrical energy that can be conserved and later used to charge devices such as phones and computers. This is an excellent way of harnessing wasted energy in the world and helping preserve energy to save the planet.</p>

					<p>During my first co-op at Northeastern, I worked at a company called ZwitterCo. ZwitterCo's membrane products are designed for water treatment, precision separation, and product recovery in a wide range of industrial and agricultural processes. I was responsible for helping manage the supply chain, manufacturing polymer in the lab used to make membrane products, and contributing to new R&D projects.</p>

					<p>During high school, I worked in a lab focusing on toxicity testing of planarian worms. Recent studies have shown that a lack of folate in women can lead to autistic offspring. Correlations found between levels of folate and certain behavioral and movement changes in planaria were drawn as a parallel to autistic characteristics in humans.</p>
